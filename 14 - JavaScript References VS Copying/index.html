    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); //output: 100, 100
    age = 200; //does not affect the age2 value
    console.log(age, age2); //output 200, 100

    let name = 'Angie';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2); //output: 'Angie', 'Angie'
    name = 'Angeline'; //does not affect the name2 value
    console.log(name, name2); //output 'Angeline', 'Angie'

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Roger', 'Licia', 'Ryan', 'Angie'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players; //this actually makes a reference to the original array. Not a copy!
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Piper';
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players, team);
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();   
    // one way
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team[4] = "hee haw";
    console.log(team4);

    //OR
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    console.log(players);

    const person = {
        name: 'Jack',
        age: 30
    }
    // with Objects
    const captain = person; //making a reference instead of a copy
    captain.number = 99; //affects value in both captain & person
    console.log(captain);
    console.log(person);

    // and think we make a copy:
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, {number: 99, age: 15});
    console.log(cap2);
    console.log(person);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    //const cap3 = {...person};
    
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const angie = {
        name: 'angie',
        age: 99,
        social: {
            github: '@angiec',
        }
    };

    const dev = Object.assign({}, angie); // create a copy of an object. 1 level clone - cannot reach 'github' level
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(angie)); //deep clone
